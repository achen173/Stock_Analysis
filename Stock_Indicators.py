''' --------------------------- These are different stock price indictors---------
Exhaustion Moves and Volume
        These are generally sharp moves in price combined with a sharp increase in
        volume, which signal the potential end of a trend. We will see a decrease
        in volume after the spike in these situations

Volume and Price Reversals
        After a long price move higher or lower, if the price begins to range with
        little price movement and heavy volume, this often indicates a reversal.

Volume and Market Interest
        A rising market should see rising volume. Increasing price and decreasing
        volume show lack of interest.

Bullish Sign
        volume increases on a price decline and then the price moves higher, followed
        by a move back lower. If the price on the move back lower stays higher than
        the previous low and volume is diminished on the second decline, then this is
        usually interpreted as a bullish sign

On-Balance Volume
        Starting from an arbitrary number, volume is added when the market finishes
        higher, or volume is subtracted when the market finishes lower. This provides
        a running total and shows which stocks are being accumulated. It can also show
        divergences

Chaikin Money Flow
        Rising prices should be accompanied by rising volume, so this formula focuses on
        expanding volume when prices finish in the upper or lower portion of their daily
        range and then provides a value for the corresponding strength. When closes are
        in the upper portion of the range and volume is expanding, the values will be
        high; when closes are in the lower portion of the range, values will be negative

Klinger Oscillator
        Fluctuation above and below the zero line can be used to aid other trading signals.
        The Klinger oscillator sums the accumulation (buying) and distribution (selling)
        volumes for a given time period
