Volume          measure of how much of a given financial asset has been traded in a given 
                period of time, or how many times the asset has been bought or sold over a 
                particular span

                Stop-loss orders are designed to limit an investor’s loss on a position in a 
                security

Free cash flow  represents the cash a company generates after cash outflows to support operations 
                and maintain its capital assets

Dilution        when a company issues new stock which results in a decrease of an existing 
                stockholder's ownership percentage of that company. 
                
Delta           rate of change between the option's price and a $1 change in the underlying asset's 
                price. In other words, the price sensitivity of the option relative to the underlying. 
                Delta of a call option has a range between zero and one, while the delta of a put 
                option has a range between zero and negative one. For example, assume an investor is 
                long a call option with a delta of 0.50. Therefore, if the underlying stock increases 
                by $1, the option's price would theoretically increase by 50 cents.

Theta           rate of change between the option price and time, or time sensitivity. Theta indicates 
                the amount an option's price would decrease as the time to expiration decreases. For 
                example, assume an investor is long an option with a theta of -0.50. The option's price 
                would decrease by 50 cents every day that passes, all else being equal. If three trading 
                days pass, the option's value would theoretically decrease by $1.50.

Gamma           rate of change between an option's delta and the underlying asset's price. This is called 
                second-order price sensitivity. Gamma indicates the amount the delta would change given a 
                $1 move in the underlying security. For example, suppose that two options have the same 
                Delta value, but one option has a high Gamma and one has a low Gamma. The option with the 
                higher Gamma will have a higher risk since an unfavorable move in the underlying stock will 
                have an oversized impact. High Gamma values mean that the option tends to experience volatile 
                swings, which is a bad thing for most traders looking for predictable opportunities.

Vega            rate of change between an option's value and the underlying asset's implied volatility. 
                This is the option's sensitivity to volatility. Vega indicates the amount an option's price 
                changes given a 1% change in implied volatility. For example, in-the-money call option with a 
                $139.00 strike price has a Vega of 0.085, which means that the option’s price will increase 
                about $0.09 for each 1% increase in implied volatility. Similarly, the out-of-the-money call 
                option with a $160.00 strike price has a Vega of 0.212, which means that it will increase about 
                $0.21 for each 1% increase in IV. When option prices are bid up, implied volatility will 
                increase, and vice versa when option prices move lower
                
Rho             rate of change between an option's value and a 1% change in the interest rate. This measures 
                sensitivity to the interest rate. For example, assume a call option has a rho of 0.05 and a price 
                of $1.25. If interest rates rise by 1%, the value of the call option would increase to $1.30, all 
                else being equal. The opposite is true for put options.
